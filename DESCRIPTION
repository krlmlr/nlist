Description: Create and manipulate numeric list (nlist) objects.
  An nlist is an S3 class list of uniquely named numeric atomic (natomic) objects.
  An natomic object is an integer or double vector, matrix or array.
  Numeric list objects are of interest because they are the raw data inputs 
  for analytic engines such as JAGS, STAN and TMB.
